# Influence of input variables

The model is fed with input variables parameterized as follows:
* Population growth [^7ac6]: based on a projection from INSEE (2006) equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 0.3%/year over the period 2012-2050.
* Growth in household income: extrapolates the average trend of 1.2%/year given by INSEE (see paragraph 2.3.1) uniformly across all income categories.
* Energy prices: based on a scenario from ADEME using assumptions from the Directorate General for Energy and Climate (DGEC) and the European Commission (see Figure 15). The scenario used is equivalent to an average annual growth rate of fuel prices after tax of 1.42% for natural gas, 2.22% for fuel oil, 1.10% for electricity and 1.20% for fuel wood over the period. These lead to an average annual growth rate of the price index of 1.47%/year.


The influence of technological progress, energy prices and aggregate household income is assessed by comparing the
reference scenario to alternatives in which they are frozen one after the other.[^1]
[^1]: Changing the order in which the variables are frozen has little impact, which suggests that non-linearities are
not too important in the model.

Figure illustrates the resulting effect on the aggregate final energy consumption for heating, the main output of the model. It
shows that energy consumption decreases autonomously from 15% to 30%, depending on the scenarios considered, between
2012 and 2050. Freezing technological progress increases energy consumption by 12% in 2050 relative to the reference
scenario. Additionally, freezing energy prices further increases energy consumption by 20%. Lastly, freezing income
decreases energy consumption by another 15%.

Figures 17 and 18 illustrate effects on the intensive and extensive margin of renovation. Figure 17 shows that freezing
technological progress significantly reduces the annual flow of renovations. Additionally freezing energy prices
reinforces this effect, while freezing income has no additional effect. The declining trend observed in the all-frozen
scenario illustrates the depletion of the potential for profitable renovations as a result of past renovations. The
comparison with the other scenarios shows that technological progress and, to a lesser extent, increasing energy prices
are augmenting this potential. Figure 18 shows that the scenarios with the highest number of renovations generate fewer
numbers in the low-efficiency labels (G to C) and more in high-efficiency ones (B and A).

The aggregate heating intensity decreases with the theoretical budget share dedicated to heating (Figure 19), which in
turn decreases with the energy performance of the dwelling, decreases with household income and increases with the price
of energy. The effect of the energy price on this quantity is ambiguous since, in addition to the direct effect just
mentioned, there is the indirect effect discussed in the previous paragraph that the energy price stimulates
renovations. The fact that the curve with non-frozen energy prices crosses that with frozen energy prices (both with
frozen technological change) suggests that the direct effect dominates in the short term while the indirect effect
dominates in the long term. The comparison of the first two scenarios indicates that freezing technological change
reduces heating intensity, an effect due, as we have seen previously, to a lesser improvement in energy efficiency.
Finally, the comparison of the last two scenarios illustrates the positive effect of income growth on heating intensity.
It is important to note that, at the same time, the growth in aggregate income increases the surface area of dwellings
to be heated.

**Evolution of heating intensity**

To sum up:

* The reduction in energy consumption is to a large extent autonomous, that is, important even when all key drivers are
  frozen;
* The rise in energy prices stimulates renovation and reduces intensity of heating; the former effect tends to take over
  the latter in the long term;
* Technological progress has a pure effect of improving energy efficiency;
* Income growth increases energy consumption by increasing both the area to be heated and the intensity of heating.

Figure 20 displays the evolution of the share of dwellings in fuel poverty, as measured by the income-to-price ratio
that counts the households spending more than 10% of their income on heating. It shows that, when all key drivers are
frozen, this count consistently declines. The increase in income naturally accelerates this trend, while the increase in
energy prices does the opposite. In comparison, technological change has a modest effect on reducing fuel poverty.
