### Influence of credit constraints

To assess the influence of credit constraints, we set discount rates as follows:
- **Reference**: the discount rates are those described in Table 15;
- **No credit constraints**: all discount rates are equal to 7%;
- **Public investment**: all discount rates are equal to 4%.

As shown in Figures 25 to 28, these variants have relatively modest effects on renovation dynamics and aggregate
consumption. Credit constraints therefore do not seem to play a major role in the model. This result is consistent with
the conclusions of the sensitivity analysis to which Res-IRF 2.0 was subjected (Branger et al., 2015).
