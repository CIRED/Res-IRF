The cost-efficiency indicator (CE score) relates the additional investment costs to the benefits they generate in terms
of energy savings and CO2 emissions.

The logic of the indicator is to relate, for each year, the additional investments (aid for energy innovation and
remaining load) compared to the reference scenario to the additional energy savings generated. The double-difference
calculation seems particularly suitable at first sight because it allows the marginal effect of the compared scenario to
be isolated each year. The cost-efficiency indicator (CE score) relates the additional investment costs to the benefits
they generate in terms of energy savings and CO2 emissions.
