## Context

The Res-IRF model [^e630] is a tool for simulating energy consumption for space heating in the French residential
sector. Its main characteristic is to integrate a detailed description of the energy performance of the dwelling stock
with a rich description of household behaviour. Res-IRF has been developed to improve the behavioural realism that
integrated models of energy demand typically lack (Mundaca et al., 2010; McCollum et al., 2017).

Fed by population growth, household income growth and energy prices as exogenous inputs, the model returns construction
and renovation costs and flows, energy consumption and heating comfort as endogenous outputs (cf. Figure 1). This
process is iterated on an annual time-step basis. The energy efficiency of a dwelling is characterized by its Energy
Performance Certificate (EPC, diagnostic de performance énergétique ) and energy efficiency improvements correspond to
upgrades to a more efficient label. Energy consumption results from household decisions along three margins: the
extensive margin of investment – the decision of whether or not to renovate –, the intensive margin of investment – the
magnitude of the energy efficiency upgrade – and the intensity with which the heating infrastructure is used after
renovation. Investment decisions are based on a net present value (NPV) calculation that incorporates a number of
barriers at the source of the so-called ‘energy-efficiency gap’ – the discrepancy between observed energy-efficiency
levels and those predicted by engineering studies (Jaffe and Stavins, 1994; Sorrell, 2004; Gillingham et al., 2009;
Allcott and Greenstone, 2012). These include: myopic expectation of energy prices, hidden costs of renovation (e.g.,
inconvenience associated with insulation works), barriers to collective decision-making within homeowner associations,
split incentives between landlords and tenants, credit constraints, and the so-called rebound effect. The main
innovation of version 3.0 is that these decisions are now also a function of household income.

[^e630]: The acronym Res-IRF stands for the Residential module of IMACLIM-R France. Also developed at CIRED, IMACLIM-R
France is a general equilibrium model of the French economy (Sassi et al., 2010). The two models are linked in Giraudet
et al. (2012) and Mathy et al. (2015). The linkage in these papers is ‘soft’ in that it only concerns energy markets:
Res-IRF sends energy demand to IMACLIM-R France which in turn sends back updated energy prices.

## Previous developments

The development of Res-IRF has produced six peer-reviewed articles to this day, of which an overview is provided in
Table 1.

## Data used in version 3.0

Previous versions of Res-IRF were parameterized on data published in 2008 by the Agence nationale de l’habitat (ANAH,
2008). A major step forward for the time, this database aggregated data of varying quality from different sources. A
number of extrapolations made up for missing (e.g., the number of dwellings built before 1975) or imprecise (e.g.,
occupancy status of decision-makers) data.

The version 3.0 of the model is now mainly based on data from the Phébus survey (Performance de l’Habitat, Équipements,
Besoins et USages de l’énergie ). Published in 2014, the Phébus data represented a substantial improvement in knowledge
of the housing stock and its occupants. Specifically, a more systematic data collection procedure allowed for new
information (in particular on household income) and improved accuracy of previously available information. These
advances now permit assessment of the distributional aspects of residential energy consumption.

The Phébus survey has two components:

- The so-called “Clode” sample details the characteristics of dwellings, their occupants and their energy expenditure.
  Specific weights are assigned to each household type to ensure that the sample is representative of the French
  population.
- The so-called “EPC” sample complements, for a subsample of 44% of households in the Clode sample, socio-economic data
  with certain physical data, including the energy consumption predicted by the EPC label. In Res-IRF, specific weights
  are assigned to this sub-sample, based on Denjean (2014).

To parameterize the model, we matched the two components in a single database. Without further specification, the
matched database is the one we refer to when we mention Phébus in the text.

In addition to the Phébus data, we calibrate correction parameters so that the model outputs at the initial year are
consistent with the data produced by the Centre d'études et de recherches économiques sur l’énergie (CEREN). The CEREN
data differ from the Phébus ones in their scope and the methodology used to produce them. They however serve as a
reference for most projections of energy consumption in France.

## Specification of Version 3.0

The model is calibrated on base year 2012. What we refer to as existing dwellings corresponds to the stock of dwellings
available in 2012, minus annual destructions. What we refer to as new dwellings is the cumulative sum of dwellings
constructed after 2012.

### Building stock

The model contains 1,080 types of dwellings divided into:

- Nine energy performance levels – EPC labels A to G for existing dwellings, Low Energy Building (LE) and Net Zero
  Energy Building (NZ) levels for new dwellings (see corresponding energy use in Table 6);
- Four main heating fuels – electricity, natural gas, fuel oil and fuel wood
- Six types of investors – owner-occupiers, landlords or social housing managers, each in single- and multi-family
  dwellings;
- Five categories of household income, the boundaries of which are aligned with those of INSEE quintiles.

#### Scope

Res-IRF 3.0 covers 23.9 million principal residences in metropolitan France among the 27.1 million covered by the
Phébus-Clode survey for the year 2012. This scope differs from that of other databases (see Figure 2). It was delineated
by excluding from the Phébus sample: those dwellings heated with fuels with low market shares, such as liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) and district heating; some dwellings for which it was not possible to identify a principal energy
carrier; some dwellings for which the Phébus data were missing.

## Energy use

The model uses two metrics for energy use: the conventional consumption predicted by the EPC label of the dwelling; and
the actual consumption that determines energy expenditure. The two are linked by the intensity of heating of the heating
infrastructure, which is an endogenous function of the model.

### Conventional energy use

Integrating new data on specific consumption (kWh/m²/year) and housing surface area (m²) allowed us to improve the
accuracy of total consumption parameters (kWh/year).

#### Specific consumption

The conventional specfic consumption of an existing dwelling is directly given by its EPC label. In Res-IRF 2.0, each
label was assigned an energy consumption equal to the middle of EPC band. By including a precise measurement of the
conventional energy consumption of each dwelling, the Phébus-DPE database made it possible to estimate for each band an
average consumption. The resulting values are those used in version 3.0; they compared to the previous ones in Figure 8.

Since the EPC covers energy consumption for heating, hot water and air conditioning, adjustments are needed to isolate
the part specifically dedicated to heating. In Res-IRF 2.0, this part was set to 0.8, based on CEREN data. Here again,
the Phébus-DPE database, by distinguishing energy between heating use, hot water use and photovoltaic production, makes
it possible to estimate an average share dedicated to heating for each EPC band. | **EPC band** | **Average
consumption (kWh/m²/year)** | **Share dedicated to heating** | **Average consumption for heating in Res-IRF (
kWh/m²/an)** | | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | | **G** | 596 | 0.85 | **507** | | **F** |
392 | 0.82 | **321** | | **E** | 280 | 0.77 | **216** | | **D** | 191 | 0.74 | **141** | | **C** | 125 | 0.72 | **90** |
| **B** | 76 | 0.77 | **59** | | **A** | 40 | 1.12 | **45** | | **LE** | 50 | 0.40 | **20** | | **NZ** | 40 | 0.40 | **
16** |

New dwellings fall into two categories of energy performance: Low Energy (LE) level, aligned with the prevailing
building code at 50 kWh/m²/year of primary energy, and Net Zero Energy (NZ) level, mandating zero consumption, net of
production from renewable sources. Since we focus on gross energy consumption, we assign a consumption of 40
kWhEP/m²/year to NZ dwellings. The same coefficient of 0.4 is applied to BBC and BEPOS consumption in order to isolate
heating from the five usages covered by building code prescriptions (instead of three usages in the case of the EPC in
existing dwellings). Note that the energy requirements of EPC band A are also net of production from renewable sources.
Our focus on gross consumption leads us to apply a coefficient that is greater than 1. These calculations are detailed
in Table 6.

##### Surface area

The same approach was used to re-set surface area parameters bases on average values estimated on Phébus data, by
category of dwelling. Descriptive statistics are provided in Figure 9 and compared to the values used in version 2.0.

#### Actual energy use

A growing number of academic studies point to a gap between the conventional energy consumption predicted by energy
performance certificates and actual energy consumption. The most common explanation is a more intense heating of the
heating infrastructure after an energy efficiency improvement – a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “rebound
effect.” [^213a]

In versions 1.0 and 2.0, the intensity of use was determined by conventional heating expenditure, based on work carried
out by EDF R&D (Allibe, 2015)[^52c2]. It therefore depended on two variables: the energy performance of the dwelling,
measured by its EPC label, and the price of energy. In version 3.0, we included a third variable: household income. This
development was made possible by several improvements in the data available, including the Phébus database and
additional work by EDF R&D (Cayla and Osso, 2013), which now connects heating intensity to the income share devoted to
heating, i.e. conventional expenditure as a percentage of income.

Heating intensity in Res-IRF now follows the following equation:
$$ Heating Intensity=-0,191*log⁡(Income Share)+0,1105 $$

with:
$$ Heating Intensity= (Actual energy use)/(Conventional energy use) $$

and:
$$ Income Share=(Energy price*Surface*Conventional energy use)/Income $$

[^213a]: See for example Aydin et al (2017). Another explanation sometimes put forward is the pre-bound effect,
according to which consumption before renovation, from which energy savings are predicted, is overestimated (
Sunikka-Blank et al., 2012).
[^52c2]: The relationaship was: $intensity of use = 3.5309 *exp(-0.643 *log (conventional expenditure per m2))$

Figure 10 compares the relationship used in Res-IRF version 3.0 with that used in version 2.0, based on an average
surface area of 85m² and an average annual income of €30,000. The new relationship is less steep, reflecting a
compensating effect of income on energy prices (both leading to a leftward shift on the horizontal axis). With this new
formula, the aggregate heating intensity in Res-IRF is now 0.74 at the initial year, instead of 0.55 in the previous
version.

#### Total energy use

The total final actual energy consumption generated by Res-IRF from the Phébus data for the initial year differs from
the values produced by CEREN. As mentioned above (see Figures 2 and 5), these differences are due to differing scopes
between the Phébus and CEREN databases and to the adjustments needed to select the main heating fuel (see Section 2.1.4)
.

To ensure consistency with the CEREN data, which is the reference commonly used in modelling exercises, Res-IRF is
calibrated to reproduce the final energy consumption given by CEREN for each fuel in 2012. The resulting conversion
coefficients are listed in Table 7. They indicate that Res-IRF reproduces natural gas and heating oil consumption fairly
accurately, with an error of around 5%. On the other hand, electricity consumption is clearly overestimated and
fuel-wood consumption is greatly underestimated. The succinct documentation of the CEREN database did not allow us to
clearly identify the reasons for these biases. However, it can reasonably be assumed that they are attributable to the
procedure for selecting a main heating fuel in Res-IRF, which probably implies some substitution of electricity for wood
in dwellings that are mainly heated with electricity but use wood as auxiliary heating. The difficulties inherent in
converting different forms of wood (logs, pellets, etc.) into TWh can also explain the differences observed in wood
consumption.

## Energy efficiency improvements

### Stock dynamics

The number of dwellings and their surface area are determined each year in Res-IRF by exogenous projections of
population and aggregate household income projection. The former is based on INSEE (2006); in the absence of an
authoritative scenario, the latter is based on a growth assumption of 1.2%/year, which extrapolates the trend given by
INSEE for the period 2009-2013[^dd29]. Based on the annual needs thus determined, the total housing stock is divided
into two components:

- The stock of “existing dwellings” corresponds to the total stock of the initial year. It is eroded at a rate of
  0.35%/year due to destruction, based on Allaire et al. (2008). Destructions are assumed to affect in priority the
  lowest energy performance labels, based on Traisnel (2001).
- New constructions are calculated so as to meet housing needs, determined by total projected housing needs net of the
  existing stock. The cumulative sum of new constructions since the initial year constitutes the stock of “new
  dwellings.”

[^dd29]: Based on a gross disposable household income of €1,318.3 billion in
2012 (https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2569356?sommaire=2587886).

This specification produces a flow of new constructions of 365,000 in 2013, 357,000 in 2014 and 348,000 in 2015, similar
to the average of 374,000 given by INSEE (2018) over a slightly wider area including the French overseas departments and
territories, except Mayotte.

In Res-IRF 2.0, the share of single- and multi-family dwellings was held constant in both existing and new housing
stocks, but at different levels; it therefore evolved in the total stock by a simple composition effect. These dynamics
are now more precisely parameterized in Res-IRF 3.0 thanks to recent empirical work linking the increase in the share of
multi-family housing in the total stock to the rate of growth of the total stock housing growth (Fisch et al., 2015) (
Figure 11). This relationship in particular reflects urbanization effects. The share of owner-occupied and rented
dwellings is held constant.

### Investment decisions – general case

The energy performance of the housing stock in Res-IRF is affected by both the construction of new dwellings and the
renovation of existing ones. Both effects are modelled by discrete choice functions. Generally speaking, the owner of a
dwelling of initial performance i∈{1…n} chooses to upgrade it to an option of final performance f∈{i+1,…,n} by comparing
its life-cycle cost to that of other options. The life-cycle cost $LCC_{i,f}$ of an option is the sum of three terms:
$$ LCC_{i,f}= INV_{i,f}+ γ * ENER_f + IC_{i,f} $$

where INV is the investment cost; ENER is the life-cycle discounted cost of conventional energy use, calculated using
the energy price for the year under consideration; IC are some “intangible costs,” representing non-energy attributes of
the investment, such as aesthetic or acoustic benefits, inconvenience generated by insulation works, etc..

The assumption of myopic expectation, which materializes by applying the discount factor to the contemporaneous energy
price, is justified by a number of econometric studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2013). The discount factor γ depends on
the discount rate r and the investment horizon l according to the following relationship:

$$γ(r,l)=∑_{t=0} (1+r)^{-t} = (1-(1+r)^{-l)})/r$$

The two parameters are set in Res-IRF so as to capture various barriers to home renovation:

- The discount rate captures both the tighter credit constraints facing lower-income households and the barriers to
  decision-making within homeowner associations.
- The investment horizon reflects the intensity with which real estate and rental markets capitalize the “green value”
  of the housing, i.e., magnitude of the rental or resale premium for a property that has just undergone energy
  efficiency improvements.

The market share $MS_{i,f}$ of upgrades from labels i to f, resulting from the aggregation of individual choices, is
determined by their life-cycle cost from the following equation:

$$ MS_{i,f} = LCC_{i,f}^{-v}/(∑_{k=i+1} LCC_{i,k} ^{-v} ) $$

Parameter v characterizing the heterogeneity of preferences is set to 8 in the model.[^d4ae]  Intangible costs are
calibrated so that the observed market shares are reproduced in the initial year.

[^d4ae]: In the absence of data allowing a more precise estimate, this value is set in an ad hoc manner. Sensitivity
analysis of the model has shown that this parameter only had a small influence on the simulated energy consumption (
Branger et al., 2015).

The paragraphs thereafter describe in detail the specification of energy efficiency improvements, which are based on two
types of technical data – the market shares of the different options in the initial year and their investment cost – and
two types of behavioural data – the discount rate and the investment horizon.

### New constructions

Construction costs at the LE and NZ levels have been updated in Res-IRF 3.0 based on estimates recently made available
by CGDD (2015) [^de8a]
| |**Single-family dwellings**|**Single-family dwellings**|**Multi-family dwellings**|**Multi-family dwellings**|
|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| |**Low Energy**             |**Net Zero Energy**       |**Low Energy**|**Net Zero Energy**| |**Electricity**|979 |1
112 |1 199|1 308| |**Natural gas**|1 032 |1 059 |1 242|1 253| |**Fuel oil**   |1 032 |1 059 |1 242|1 253| |**Fuel wood**
|1 094 |1 121 |1 323|1 350|

[^de8a]: The study does not include information on housing heated with fuel oil or on multi-family homes heated with
wood. The former are therefore assigned the costs of new buildings heated with natural gas, and the latter the costs of
single-family homes heated with wood, to which we add the average additional cost of multi-family homes.

The market shares used to calibrate intangible costs were also updated, based on trends provided by CEREN (Figure 12).

The massive penetration of natural gas at the expense of electric heating observed over the past ten years in
multi-family housing is mainly due to the anticipation and subsequent application of the 2012 building code. In order to
abstract from short-term variations, the 2012 market shares are set in Res-IRF on the average of the years 2012-2015 (
Table 9).

|                           |**Electricity**|**Natural gas**|**Fuel oil**|**Fuel wood**|**_Total_**|
|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
|**Single-family dwellings**|75.3%          |18.5%          |0.5%        |5.8%         |_100%_     |
|**Multi-family dwellings** |19.5%          |79.5%          |0.0%        |1.0%         |_100%_     |

Considering that the quality of new constructions results from decisions made by building and real estate professionals
rather than by future owners, we subject these decisions in the model to private investment criteria, reflected by a
discount rate of 7% and a time horizon of 35 years.

### Renovation of existing dwellings

The model simultaneously determines the number of renovations and their performance. The process is therefore more
complex than in new construction, where the two margins are distinct. For the sake of clarity, we hereafter describe
them sequentially.

#### Intensive margin

Renovation costs $INV_{i,f}$ are described by an upper diagonal matrix linking the initial EPC label i of the dwelling
to its final label f (Table 10). Parameterization of the matrix is based on piecemeal data supplemented with values
interpolated according to the following principles:

- Decreasing returns, i.e., increasing incremental cost of renovation: $INV_{i,f+2}-INV_{i,f+1} > INV_{i,f+1} - INV_
  {i,f}$.
- Economies of scale, i.e., deep retrofits costing less than a succession of incremental renovations: $INV_{i,f} < INV_
  {i,i+k} + INV_{i+k,f}$ for all k such that $1≤k<f-i$.
