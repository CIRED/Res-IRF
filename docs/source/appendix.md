## Conda environment

### Creating an environment from an environment.yml file
Tutorial comes from [this website](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)  
Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

1. Create the environment from the environment.yml file:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name.

2. Activate the new environment:
`conda activate myenv`

3. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
`conda env list`
You can also use `conda info --envs`.

### Sharing an environment
Tutorial comes from [this website](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)  
You may want to share your environment with someone else---for example, so they can re-create a test that you have done. To allow them to quickly reproduce your environment, with all of its packages and versions, give them a copy of your environment.yml file.
1. Activate the environment to export: `conda activate myenv`
   Replace myenv with the name of the environment
2. Export your active environment to a new file:
`conda env export > environment.yml`
3. Email or copy the exported `environment.yml` file to the other person.



## Jupyter Notebook

### Kernels

#### Create kernel from conda environment

Tutorial comes from [this website](https://medium.com/@nrk25693/how-to-add-your-conda-environment-to-your-jupyter-notebook-in-just-4-steps-abeab8b8d084)  
**Step 1**: Create a Conda environment.
`conda create --name firstEnv`

**Step 2**: Activate the environment using the command as shown in the console. After you activate it, you can install any package you need in this environment.
`conda install library`

**Step 3**: Create Jupyter Kernel.
Now comes the step to set this conda environment on your jupyter notebook, to do so please install ipykernel.
`conda install -c anaconda ipykernel`
After installing this, just type:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=firstEnv`

**Step 4**: Just check your Jupyter Notebook, to see the shining firstEnv.

#### List kernels
`jupyter kernelspec list`
#### Remove kernel
`jupyter kernelspec remove <kernel-name>`
