<h3>Overview of the model<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Res-IRF model <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#e630" id="id1">2</a> is a tool for simulating energy consumption for space heating in the French residential
sector. Its main characteristic is to integrate a detailed description of the energy performance of the dwelling stock
with a rich description of household behaviour. Res-IRF has been developed to improve the behavioural realism that
integrated models of energy demand typically lack (Mundaca et al., 2010; McCollum et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Fed by population growth, household income growth and energy prices as exogenous inputs, the model returns construction
and renovation costs and flows, energy consumption and heating comfort as endogenous outputs (cf. Figure 1). This
process is iterated on an annual time-step basis. The energy efficiency of a dwelling is characterized by its Energy
Performance Certificate (EPC, diagnostic de performance énergétique ) and energy efficiency improvements correspond to
upgrades to a more efficient label. Energy consumption results from household decisions along three margins: the
extensive margin of investment – the decision of whether or not to renovate –, the intensive margin of investment – the
magnitude of the energy efficiency upgrade – and the intensity with which the heating infrastructure is used after
renovation. Investment decisions are based on a net present value (NPV) calculation that incorporates a number of
barriers at the source of the so-called ‘energy-efficiency gap’ – the discrepancy between observed energy-efficiency
levels and those predicted by engineering studies (Jaffe and Stavins, 1994; Sorrell, 2004; Gillingham et al., 2009;
Allcott and Greenstone, 2012). These include: myopic expectation of energy prices, hidden costs of renovation (e.g.,
inconvenience associated with insulation works), barriers to collective decision-making within homeowner associations,
split incentives between landlords and tenants, credit constraints, and the so-called rebound effect. The main
innovation of version 3.0 is that these decisions are now also a function of household income.</p>

<h2>Specification of Version 3.0<a class="headerlink" href="#specification-of-version-3-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The model is calibrated on base year 2012. What we refer to as existing dwellings corresponds to the stock of dwellings
available in 2012, minus annual destructions. What we refer to as new dwellings is the cumulative sum of dwellings
constructed after 2012.</p>
<section id="data-used-in-version-3-0">
<h3>Data used in version 3.0<a class="headerlink" href="#data-used-in-version-3-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Previous versions of Res-IRF were parameterized on data published in 2008 by the Agence nationale de l’habitat (ANAH,
2008). A major step forward for the time, this database aggregated data of varying quality from different sources. A
number of extrapolations made up for missing (e.g., the number of dwellings built before 1975) or imprecise (e.g.,
occupancy status of decision-makers) data.</p>
<p>The version 3.0 of the model is now mainly based on data from the Phébus survey (Performance de l’Habitat, Équipements,
Besoins et USages de l’énergie ). Published in 2014, the Phébus data represented a substantial improvement in knowledge
of the housing stock and its occupants. Specifically, a more systematic data collection procedure allowed for new
information (in particular on household income) and improved accuracy of previously available information. These
advances now permit assessment of the distributional aspects of residential energy consumption.</p>
<p>The Phébus survey has two components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The so-called “Clode” sample details the characteristics of dwellings, their occupants and their energy expenditure.
Specific weights are assigned to each household type to ensure that the sample is representative of the French
population.</p></li>
<li><p>The so-called “EPC” sample complements, for a subsample of 44% of households in the Clode sample, socio-economic data
with certain physical data, including the energy consumption predicted by the EPC label. In Res-IRF, specific weights
are assigned to this sub-sample, based on Denjean (2014).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To parameterize the model, we matched the two components in a single database. Without further specification, the
matched database is the one we refer to when we mention Phébus in the text.</p>
<p>In addition to the Phébus data, we calibrate correction parameters so that the model outputs at the initial year are
consistent with the data produced by the Centre d’études et de recherches économiques sur l’énergie (CEREN). The CEREN
data differ from the Phébus ones in their scope and the methodology used to produce them. They however serve as a
reference for most projections of energy consumption in France.</p>

<h3>Building stock<a class="headerlink" href="#building-stock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The model contains 1,080 types of dwellings divided into:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nine energy performance levels – EPC labels A to G for existing dwellings, Low Energy Building (LE) and Net Zero
Energy Building (NZ) levels for new dwellings (see corresponding energy use in Table 6);</p></li>
<li><p>Four main heating fuels – electricity, natural gas, fuel oil and fuel wood</p></li>
<li><p>Six types of investors – owner-occupiers, landlords or social housing managers, each in single- and multi-family
dwellings;</p></li>
<li><p>Five categories of household income, the boundaries of which are aligned with those of INSEE quintiles.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="scope">
<h4>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Res-IRF 3.0 covers 23.9 million principal residences in metropolitan France among the 27.1 million covered by the
Phébus-Clode survey for the year 2012. This scope differs from that of other databases (see Figure 2). It was delineated
by excluding from the Phébus sample: those dwellings heated with fuels with low market shares, such as liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) and district heating; some dwellings for which it was not possible to identify a principal energy
carrier; some dwellings for which the Phébus data were missing.</p>

<p>The number of dwellings in each EPC band is directly given by Phébus-DPE. Figure 3 compares the distribution of EPC
labels in versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the model. The stock in the latter is less energy efficient in year 2012 than was that
of the former in year 2008, with more dwellings in lower EPC bands (G-E) and fewer in upper bands (D-A).</p>

<p>Table 4 specifies the joint distribution of building characteristics (singe- and multi-family dwellings) and types of
investors (owner-occupied, landlord, social housing manager). Figure 4 shows that this distribution does not
substantially differ from that previously used. Note that, although the Phébus database makes it possible to separate
single- and multi-family dwellings within social housing stock, the two categories are collapsed in the figure to
facilitate comparison.</p>

<h4>Heating fuel<a class="headerlink" href="#heating-fuel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The model covers energy use for heating from electricity, natural gas, fuel oil and fuel wood. This cope covers 16% of
final energy consumption in France. We consider only the main heating fuel used in each dwelling. To identify it from
the Phébus-Clode database, we proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>We retain the main heating fuel when declared as such by the respondents.</p></li>
<li><p>When several main fuels are declared, we assign to the dwelling a heating fuel according to the following order of
priority: district heating &gt; collective boiler &gt; individual boiler &gt; all-electric &gt; heat pump &gt; other.</p></li>
<li><p>When no main fuel is reported, we retain the main fuel declared as auxiliary, determined with the following order
of priority: <em>electric heater &gt; all-electric &gt; mixed base &gt; fixed non-electric &gt; chimney</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Energy consumption in Phébus</strong><br />
<img alt="energy_consumption_3" src="_images/energy_consumption_3.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 5 compares the total consumption of each fuel in the Phébus database and in the model. It shows that retaining
only one fuel for each dwelling leads us to consider much less electricity and wood consumption than reported in Phébus.
This is due for the most part to our exclusion of auxiliary heating, which predominantly uses electricity and wood, and
to a lesser extent to our exclusion of the specific electricity consumption that is reported in Phébus.</p>

<section id="household-income">
<h4>Household income<a class="headerlink" href="#household-income" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A major advance of version 3.0, the introduction of income categories was intended to capture heterogeneity in (i) the
propensity of owners to invest in energy retrofits and (ii) the intensity of use of heating infrastructure by occupants.
The level of detail of the Phébus database made this development possible. Yet since the income data it contains only
relates to occupants, additional data were needed to set income parameters for landlords.</p>
<section id="occupant">
<h5>Occupant<a class="headerlink" href="#occupant" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The disposable income of occupants – owner-occupiers and tenants – is segmented into five categories delineated by the
same income boundaries as those defining income quintiles in France, according to the national statistical office for
2012. The use of these quintiles instead of those intrinsic in the Phébus sample ensures consistency between homeowners’
and tenants’ income (see next section), without introducing too strong biases, as shown in Table 5. Each dwelling is
then allocated the average income for its category. Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of occupant income in the
different EPC bands. A clear correlation appears between household income and the energy efficiency of their dwelling.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id19" id="id2">1</a></p>

<h5>Owners<a class="headerlink" href="#owners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Homeowners’ income overlaps with occupants’. Yet Phébus does not contain any information on the income of landlords,
which we had to reconstitute by other means. We matched the Phébus-DPE data with INSEE data pre-processed by the Agence
nationale pour l’information sur le logement (ANIL, 2012). The resulting landlords’ income distribution is described in
Figure 7 and compared to that of tenants. Here again, significant disparities appear, with households whose annual
income falls below €34,210 representing 80% of tenants but only 20% of owner-occupiers.</p>

<h3>Data used in version 4.0<a class="headerlink" href="#data-used-in-version-4-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As explained in the previous section, the core of Res-IRF is a stock matrix that describes the structure of the
residential stock at an original year. Until recently, the model was based on the image of the residential stock derived
from the 2012 Phébus survey data. This is what will be called the 2012 version of Res-IRF.</p>
<p>For greater accuracy of the model projections, a new stock matrix corresponding to the image of the residential stock in
2018 was imported. This matrix was built up using data provided by the SDES as part of the research agreement between
the CGDD and the CIRED in which this work is included.</p>
<p>Another dataset was also provided to us concerning the correspondence between the incomes of landlords and those of
tenants in the private rental stock.</p>
<p>These two data sets are described in the following sections. They have been constituted by the SDES from data coming
from the Fidéli 2018 database, from the DPE 2017 and 2018 database of the ADEME and from the Enerter model of the
company Energies Demain for the dwellings built before 1948 (2).</p>

<h3>Building stock<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first dataset incorporated into Res-IRF is the new stock matrix (MAT1) representing the residential stock in 2018. It describes the number of units in the residential stock by various segments.</p>
<p>This matrix segments the 28.6 million dwellings in the residential stock (primary residences only) into five categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Energy performance level: DPE label ranging from G to A;</p></li>
<li><p>Type of housing: individual or collective;</p></li>
<li><p>Type of owner: owner-occupier, owner-lessor, social housing, free rental housing;</p></li>
<li><p>Income level of the owner: income deciles of the tenant;</p></li>
<li><p>Heating energy: natural gas, electricity, “other energy”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These data had to be reprocessed before they could be imported into Res-IRF. The following changes were made:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Deletion of housing rented free of charge: this category, present in the data provided, is not relevant in Res-IRF and represents a limited number of people;</p></li>
<li><p>Conversion of owner deciles to owner quintiles: As Res-IRF is currently adapted to handle only income quintiles and not deciles, the numbers of deciles belonging to the same quintile have been grouped together;</p></li>
<li><p>Treatment of heating energy data: the only energy categories available in the data received were natural gas, electricity and the “other energies” category. However, Res-IRF includes four types of energy: electricity, gas, but also homes heated with oil and wood. It was therefore necessary to determine the share of fuel oil and wood in the “other energy” category. For this purpose, other data on the structure of the stock in 2018 from CEREN were used (37). For each type of dwelling (single-family or multi-family), these data make it possible to obtain the percentage of dwellings heated with wood and fuel oil among those heated neither with electricity nor with gas. The assumptions used are presented in the following table.</p></li>

<li><p>Shift from tenant income to owner income: the income levels expressed in the stock matrix provided by the SDES were initially those of tenants. However, for Res-IRF to function properly, it is necessary to start by importing into the model the numbers of private rental housing stock according to the incomes of owners, as explained in section 2.2.4. It was therefore necessary to match the incomes of tenants with the incomes of owners in the private rental housing stock by means of a pass-through matrix.</p></li>

<h4>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This new structure is compared to the old version of Res-IRF, calibrated from the 2012 Phebus data. We look at both the
original 2012 fleet matrix and the projection that this 2012 calibrated version gives for the year 2018. For the
analysis of the results that follows, it is important to keep in mind that we are not comparing staff of identical size.</p>
<p>Indeed, the stock matrix used in 2012 had to be truncated even more than the one used in 2018 to be usable in Res-IRF:
it indicated a residential stock of 23.9 million dwellings in 2012 and the projection for 2018 reaches 25.5 million
dwellings. In comparison, the new data show a stock of 26.7 million dwellings in 2018.</p>

<h4>Renovation rate<a class="headerlink" href="#renovation-rate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In Res-IRF 3.0, the renovation rates used to calibrate Res-IRF were differentiated by decision maker and by ECD label.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of robustness of the data on renovation rates by EPC and the problematic results they generated with the
new image of the stock (SDES 2018), the renovation rates are now only differentiated by decision-makers. The latter have
been recalculated from data already used in the old parameterization of the renovation rates but also with other
additional data sources.</p>
<p>The 2012 version of Res-IRF (calibrated on Phébus) replicated the renovation rates observed in the French housing stock
according to the DPE and the decision maker of a dwelling. This meant using a matrix of 6 * 6 = 36 renovation rates,
which the calibration of parameters of the model (rho parameters of the renovation rate function) should make it
possible to replicate in the original year.</p>

<h2>Energy use<a class="headerlink" href="#energy-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The model uses two metrics for energy use: the conventional consumption predicted by the EPC label of the dwelling; and
the actual consumption that determines energy expenditure. The two are linked by the intensity of heating of the heating
infrastructure, which is an endogenous function of the model.</p>
<section id="conventional-energy-use">

<p>The conventional specfic consumption of an existing dwelling is directly given by its EPC label<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id19" id="id9">1</a>. In Res-IRF 2.0, each
label was assigned an energy consumption equal to the middle of EPC band. By including a precise measurement of the
conventional energy consumption of each dwelling, the Phébus-DPE database made it possible to estimate for each band an
average consumption. The resulting values are those used in version 3.0; they compared to the previous ones in Figure 8.</p>
<p><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id19" id="id10">1</a> : Final energy consumption is deducted from primary energy consumption by a coefficient of 1 for natural gas,

<img alt="statistics_energy_consumption" src="_images/statistics_energy_consumption.png" /></p>
<p>Since the EPC covers energy consumption for heating, hot water and air conditioning, adjustments are needed to isolate
the part specifically dedicated to heating. In Res-IRF 2.0, this part was set to 0.8, based on CEREN data. Here again,
the Phébus-DPE database, by distinguishing energy between heating use, hot water use and photovoltaic production, makes
it possible to estimate an average share dedicated to heating for each EPC band.</p>

<p>New dwellings fall into two categories of energy performance: Low Energy (LE) level, aligned with the prevailing
building code at 50 kWh/m²/year of primary energy, and Net Zero Energy (NZ) level, mandating zero consumption, net of
production from renewable sources. Since we focus on gross energy consumption, we assign a consumption of 40
kWhEP/m²/year to NZ dwellings. The same coefficient of 0.4 is applied to BBC and BEPOS consumption in order to isolate
heating from the five usages covered by building code prescriptions (instead of three usages in the case of the EPC in
existing dwellings). Note that the energy requirements of EPC band A are also net of production from renewable sources.
Our focus on gross consumption leads us to apply a coefficient that is greater than 1. These calculations are detailed
in Table 6.</p>

<section id="actual-energy-use">
<h4>Actual energy use<a class="headerlink" href="#actual-energy-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A growing number of academic studies point to a gap between the conventional energy consumption predicted by energy
performance certificates and actual energy consumption. The most common explanation is a more intense heating of the
heating infrastructure after an energy efficiency improvement – a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “rebound
effect.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#a" id="id11">4</a></p>
<p>In versions 1.0 and 2.0, the intensity of use was determined by conventional heating expenditure, based on work carried
out by EDF R&amp;D (Allibe, 2015)<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#c2" id="id12">5</a>. It therefore depended on two variables: the energy performance of the dwelling,
measured by its EPC label, and the price of energy. In version 3.0, we included a third variable: household income. This
development was made possible by several improvements in the data available, including the Phébus database and
additional work by EDF R&amp;D (Cayla and Osso, 2013), which now connects heating intensity to the income share devoted to
heating, i.e. conventional expenditure as a percentage of income.</p>
<p>Heating intensity in Res-IRF now follows the following equation:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Heating Intensity=-0,191*log⁡(Income Share)+0,1105 \)</span>$</p>
<p>with:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Heating Intensity= (Actual energy use)/(Conventional energy use) \)</span>$</p>
<p>and:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Income Share=(Energy price*Surface*Conventional energy use)/Income \)</span>$</p>
<p><em>Heating intensity in the current and previous versions of Res-IRF</em>
<img alt="heating_intensity_3" src="_images/heating_intensity_3.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 10 compares the relationship used in Res-IRF version 3.0 with that used in version 2.0, based on an average
surface area of 85m² and an average annual income of €30,000. The new relationship is less steep, reflecting a
compensating effect of income on energy prices (both leading to a leftward shift on the horizontal axis). With this new
formula, the aggregate heating intensity in Res-IRF is now 0.74 at the initial year, instead of 0.55 in the previous
version.</p>
</section>
<section id="total-energy-use">
<h4>Total energy use<a class="headerlink" href="#total-energy-use" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The total final actual energy consumption generated by Res-IRF from the Phébus data for the initial year differs from
the values produced by CEREN. As mentioned above (see Figures 2 and 5), these differences are due to differing scopes
between the Phébus and CEREN databases and to the adjustments needed to select the main heating fuel (see Section 2.1.4)
.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency with the CEREN data, which is the reference commonly used in modelling exercises, Res-IRF is
calibrated to reproduce the final energy consumption given by CEREN for each fuel in 2012. The resulting conversion
coefficients are listed in Table 7. They indicate that Res-IRF reproduces natural gas and heating oil consumption fairly
accurately, with an error of around 5%. On the other hand, electricity consumption is clearly overestimated and
fuel-wood consumption is greatly underestimated. The succinct documentation of the CEREN database did not allow us to
clearly identify the reasons for these biases. However, it can reasonably be assumed that they are attributable to the
procedure for selecting a main heating fuel in Res-IRF, which probably implies some substitution of electricity for wood
in dwellings that are mainly heated with electricity but use wood as auxiliary heating. The difficulties inherent in
converting different forms of wood (logs, pellets, etc.) into TWh can also explain the differences observed in wood
consumption.</p>

<h3>Stock dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#stock-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The number of dwellings and their surface area are determined each year in Res-IRF by exogenous projections of
population and aggregate household income projection. The former is based on INSEE (2006); in the absence of an
authoritative scenario, the latter is based on a growth assumption of 1.2%/year, which extrapolates the trend given by
INSEE for the period 2009-2013<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#dd29" id="id13">6</a>. Based on the annual needs thus determined, the total housing stock is divided
into two components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The stock of “existing dwellings” corresponds to the total stock of the initial year. It is eroded at a rate of
0.35%/year due to destruction, based on Allaire et al. (2008). Destructions are assumed to affect in priority the
lowest energy performance labels, based on Traisnel (2001).</p></li>
<li><p>New constructions are calculated so as to meet housing needs, determined by total projected housing needs net of the
existing stock. The cumulative sum of new constructions since the initial year constitutes the stock of “new
dwellings.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This specification produces a flow of new constructions of 365,000 in 2013, 357,000 in 2014 and 348,000 in 2015, similar
to the average of 374,000 given by INSEE (2018) over a slightly wider area including the French overseas departments and
territories, except Mayotte.</p>
<p>In Res-IRF 2.0, the share of single- and multi-family dwellings was held constant in both existing and new housing
stocks, but at different levels; it therefore evolved in the total stock by a simple composition effect. These dynamics
are now more precisely parameterized in Res-IRF 3.0 thanks to recent empirical work linking the increase in the share of
multi-family housing in the total stock to the rate of growth of the total stock housing growth (Fisch et al., 2015) (
Figure 11). This relationship in particular reflects urbanization effects. The share of owner-occupied and rented
dwellings is held constant.</p>

<section id="investment-decisions-general-case">
<h3>Investment decisions – general case<a class="headerlink" href="#investment-decisions-general-case" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The energy performance of the housing stock in Res-IRF is affected by both the construction of new dwellings and the
renovation of existing ones. Both effects are modelled by discrete choice functions. Generally speaking, the owner of a
dwelling of initial performance i∈{1…n} chooses to upgrade it to an option of final performance f∈{i+1,…,n} by comparing
its life-cycle cost to that of other options. The life-cycle cost <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(LCC_{i,f}\)</span> of an option is the sum of three terms:<br />
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(LCC_{i,f}= INV_{i,f}+ γ * ENER_f + IC_{i,f}\)</span>$</p>
<p>where INV is the investment cost; ENER is the life-cycle discounted cost of conventional energy use, calculated using
the energy price for the year under consideration; IC are some “intangible costs,” representing non-energy attributes of
the investment, such as aesthetic or acoustic benefits, inconvenience generated by insulation works, etc..</p>
<p>The assumption of myopic expectation, which materializes by applying the discount factor to the contemporaneous energy
price, is justified by a number of econometric studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2013). The discount factor γ depends on
the discount rate r and the investment horizon l according to the following relationship:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[γ(r,l)=∑_{t=0} (1+r)^{-t} = (1-(1+r)^{-l)})/r\]</div>
<p>The two parameters are set in Res-IRF so as to capture various barriers to home renovation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The discount rate captures both the tighter credit constraints facing lower-income households and the barriers to
decision-making within homeowner associations.</p></li>
<li><p>The investment horizon reflects the intensity with which real estate and rental markets capitalize the “green value”
of the housing, i.e., magnitude of the rental or resale premium for a property that has just undergone energy
efficiency improvements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The market share <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(MS_{i,f}\)</span> of upgrades from labels i to f, resulting from the aggregation of individual choices, is
determined by their life-cycle cost from the following equation:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ MS_{i,f} = LCC_{i,f}^{-v}/(∑_{k=i+1} LCC_{i,k} ^{-v} ) \]</div>
<p>Parameter v characterizing the heterogeneity of preferences is set to 8 in the model.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#d4ae" id="id14">7</a>  Intangible costs are
calibrated so that the observed market shares are reproduced in the initial year.</p>
<p>The paragraphs thereafter describe in detail the specification of energy efficiency improvements, which are based on two
types of technical data – the market shares of the different options in the initial year and their investment cost – and
two types of behavioural data – the discount rate and the investment horizon.</p>

<p>The costs reported in Table 10, weighted by the market shares reported in Tables 11 and 13, result in an average renovation cost of 112 €/m², very close to the 110 €/m² value given by OPEN (9 978 € of average expenditure compared to 91 m²). Compared to the cumulative energy savings they generate (assuming an average lifetime of 26 years), they correspond to an average “negawatt-hour cost” of 83 €/MWh, with extreme values of 25 and 446. These values are in line with those recently produced by DG Tresor (2017, Table 1).</p>
<p>Intangible costs are calibrated so that the life-cycle cost model, fed with the investment costs reported in Table 10, matches the market shares reported in Table 11. The resulting intangible costs are reported in Table 12.</p>

<p>In private housing, discount rates are differentiated by housing type in order to capture the heterogeneous constraints faced by investors (Table 15). Specifically, the discount rates decrease with the owner’s income so as to reflect tighter credit constraints faced by lower-income households. Discount rates are also higher in multi-family housing than in single-family homes to capture the difficulties associated with decision-making within homeowner associations. In social housing, on the other hand, the discount rate is set at 4%, the value commonly used in public decision-making.</p>

<p>The investment horizon is subject to different scenario variants, reflecting different intensities of market capitalization of energy savings (see Table 16):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the ‘full capitalization’ scenario, the investment horizon corresponds to the entire lifetime of energy retrofits, i.e., 30 years for improvements on the envelope and 16 years for the improvements on heating systems. Investors enjoy the benefits of the investment as long as they own the property (possibly in the form of higher rents); upon reselling, they receive a premium equal to the discounted sum of the residual monetary savings generated by the investment.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference scenario corresponds to a situation where the horizon of landlords is reduced to three years, the average term of a lease. This assumption reflects an inability to increase rents in an attempt to recoup investment. This situation, often referred to as the “landlord-tenant dilemma,” is the most common in practice (Giraudet, 2018).</p></li>
<li><p>In the ‘no sale capitalization,’ the investment horizon is limited to seven years, equivalent to the average length of ownership of a property. This assumption totally ignores the residual benefits of the investment at the time of resale.</p></li>
<li><p>In the ‘no sale nor rent capitalization’ scenario, the owner-tenant dilemma adds to the lack of capitalization of the resale premium.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Investment costs decrease exponentially with the cumulative sum of operations so as to capture the classical “learning-by-doing” process. The rate of cost reduction is set at 15% in new construction and 10% in renovation for a doubling of production.

<li><p>Intangible renovation costs decrease according to a logistic curve with the same cumulative production so as to capture peer effects and knowledge diffusion. The rate of decrease is set at 25% for a doubling of cumulative production.</p></li>

<section id="illustrative-simulations">
<h2>Illustrative simulations<a class="headerlink" href="#illustrative-simulations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To sum up, model outputs are determined by three exogenous inputs: population, household income and energy prices. The first two inputs determine the number and size of new dwellings, which influence the “extensive” margin of investment. Energy prices impact the market shares of the different renovation and construction options, thus influencing the “intensive” margin of investment. Finally, household income and energy prices influence the intensity with which the heating system is used.
We discuss below a few simulations meant to illustrate the influence of key variables and parameters. Note that, while the calibration of the model incorporates a number of energy efficiency policies detailed in Giraudet et al. (2018), for the sake of illustrating its core mechanisms these policies are removed from the model at the end of the calibration in the simulations presented here.</p>
<section id="input-variables">
<h3>Input variables<a class="headerlink" href="#input-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The model is fed with input variables parameterized as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Population growth <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ac6" id="id17">10</a>: based on a projection from INSEE (2006) equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 0.3%/year over the period 2012-2050.</p></li>
<li><p>Growth in household income: extrapolates the average trend of 1.2%/year given by INSEE (see paragraph 2.3.1) uniformly across all income categories.</p></li>
<li><p>Energy prices: based on a scenario from ADEME using assumptions from the Directorate General for Energy and Climate (DGEC) and the European Commission (see Figure 15). The scenario used is equivalent to an average annual growth rate of fuel prices after tax of 1.42% for natural gas, 2.22% for fuel oil, 1.10% for electricity and 1.20% for fuel wood over the period. These lead to an average annual growth rate of the price index of 1.47%/year.</p></li>
