The development of the Res-IRF model was initiated at CIRED in 2008. Coordinated by Louis-Gaëtan Giraudet, it involved over the years, in alphabetic order, Cyril Bourgeois, Frédéric Branger, David Glotin, Céline Guivarch and Philippe Quirion.

> The Res-IRF model is a tool for **simulating energy consumption for space heating** in the French residential sector.  Its main characteristic is to integrate a detailed description of the energy performance of the dwelling stock with a rich description of household behaviour. Res-IRF has been developed to improve the behavioural realism that integrated models of energy demand typically lack.
